<h1>Numbers</h1>
<p>I stole solace in the fact that there were others hurting worse than me
it cost me nothing, but on some spiritual level, i think they could feel the dignity being ripped away from their skin
like a band-aid that's not meant to come off
  <br>

these were the days, weeks, months, years, minutes
of being left with not quite nothing, but not quite something either
   <br>

my sister had been poor, too.
but it wasn't what I was feeling
she had taken a home in the chic kind of poor
the name-brand type of poor that's romanticized by ne'er-do-wells in the indie rock scene
   <br>

could be worse, could be worse
what could be worse? how was that supposed to make me feel any better?
the self-help books are all written by people who would've never had to pick one up in the first place.
   <br>

it was about 30 seconds later that i saw the golden catapult
the one that would fling me off the streets
no, not physically, but it's still a net gain if my mind's sleeping in a king size bed and my body's sleeping in an alley
   <br>

an electronic billboard was competing with the moon
there was a blank space on the billboard, with a rotating selection of words
the only constant on the billboard was a phone number and, next to the blank space, poverty
   <br>

it flashed by
emotional poverty, romantic poverty
it flashed by again
sexual poverty, creative poverty
it flashed by again
fufillment poverty, moral poverty</p>
