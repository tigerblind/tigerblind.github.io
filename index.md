What is it you wanted out of life? Do you ever find yourself wondering if you'll do anything of importance, do you ever stop to smell the flowers? is it all just too damn much in this day and age? if you answered yes to 0 or more of these questions, then tigerblind is the recording project for you. bringing you the freshest in indie rock, electro funk, plodding acoustic, and so much more. just one listen to any of my fine selections and you'll be hooked for life, first one's free (just kidding, they're all free). so go ahead and take it all in, think about how great i am, and lay back/relax. dig?
